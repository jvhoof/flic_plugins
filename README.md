# Flic Plugins for OSX
## PowerPoint
A plugin which controls PowerPoint 2011 through AppleScript; the control is direct, not by simulating keypresses.
It has functions for next / previous / first / last slide and can turn the screen black or white. I use this with the flic button in my pocket, and I just tap it through the fabric. Completely hands-free & simple.
